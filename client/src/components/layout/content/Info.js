        Hello! Welcome to my first MERN stack app
      </h2>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Hi! how are you? hope your fine. As you will see this my first app developed
        with the MERN stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are watching this means you already know what MERN is, if not
        take some time to google it out.<br/> I started learning React quite some time ago and then got really
        busy on my studies (unfortunately they <br/>dont have too much in common with web development). Still
        i managed to spend sometime <br/>in making this little project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are an experienced developer please take your time to check the code and give me
        some advices <br/>on how i can improve my app, how should/could i have done this and that, and
        what concepts <br/>you see i should be looking for based on what you've seen (if so).
      </p>
      <p>
          I would like to make a shift into web development and i'm open to collaborate with
          other developers in their <br/> projects, as far as i can. So message if you need some help.
      </p>
      <p>
          Thanks for your time.
      </p>
